<ul>

	<li>The network connection is lost</li>
	<li>An error was encountered when reading a layer file</li>
</ul>

	Popup notifications may contain hyperlinks that will perform specific actions related to the notification.
	If you wish to perform the associated action, simply click on the appropriate hyperlink.
